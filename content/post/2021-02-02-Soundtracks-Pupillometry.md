summary: The authors present the main findings and discuss their implications. However,
  they do not provide an explicit statement about whether each of their five hypotheses
  was supported by the results or not. The authors connect well their findings with
  the results of other studies. However, they do not provide enough discussion in
  relation to other studies for the finding that was contrary to their expectation,
  i.e. the hypothesis that the music was going to influence the affective state attributed
  to the main character of the audiovisuals. They suggest this finding might have
  been the consequence of the scales they used but they do not discuss how the results
  might have been different in light of the literature if they would have used different
  scales. The authors are exhaustive in describing all the potential limitations of
  their study and ways to address them in future research. The authors discuss how
  their studies show that music helps people to interpret an ambiguous audiovisual
  scene. They also emphasize how they have solved some of the problems previously
  identified by other authors in the literature and provide new directions for future
  research.

# Review


The abstract clearly describes the main findings of the two studies reported. However, the authors could have been more concise in describing their findings and could have provided more details about the rationale for their studies, the hypotheses, and the experimental design.

The authors provide a thorough review of the literature on how music affects the interpretation of audiovisuals. They start discussing the general aspects of the topic to continue with the specifics. The authors clearly identify the problems in the literature, which they try to solve with their experiments. The research question and the hypotheses are clearly stated. However, the hypotheses are not presented in the introduction. They are presented in the Methods section at the same time as the authors are presenting the materials. The clarity of the article could have been enhanced by presenting the hypotheses earlier on.

The authors describe the gender and age of participants and inform the reader that they used a convenient sample: online participants recruited through Amazon Mechanical Turk. It is understandable that they used online participants as they want to ensure the ecological validity of their study at the same time they want to infer cause-effect relationships between variables. Nevertheless, the information about the participant recruitment is presented in different places in the text instead of all at once at the beginning of the methods section. The study is a between-subjects experimental design with two experimental conditions and the control condition. The design is clearly presented but the number of participants in each condition is missing. The procedure is succinctly presented and clear details about the scales used to measure the different constructs are given.

Again, however, the order of presentation of the information is confusing as it is presented in an unconventional way: the authors describe the procedure before the materials and explain the materials at the same time as the hypotheses.

The analytic strategy is clearly presented. They start discussing the exclusion criteria they implemented to ensure the quality of the data provided by the online participants. They provide measures of the reliability of the scales used to measure the different constructs, and the selection of statistical techniques is appropriate for their research questions. The authors should be praised for how they report their statistical analyses. They provide descriptive statistics (means and standard deviations) for the variables of interest as well as appropriate significant tests, effect sizes, and statistical power for each of their tests.

The authors present the main findings and discuss their implications. However, they do not provide an explicit statement about whether each of their five hypotheses was supported by the results or not. The authors connect well their findings with the results of other studies. However, they do not provide enough discussion in relation to other studies for the finding that was contrary to their expectation, i.e. the hypothesis that the music was going to influence the affective state attributed to the main character of the audiovisuals. They suggest this finding might have been the consequence of the scales they used but they do not discuss how the results might have been different in light of the literature if they would have used different scales. The authors are exhaustive in describing all the potential limitations of their study and ways to address them in future research. The authors discuss how their studies show that music helps people to interpret an ambiguous audiovisual scene. They also emphasize how they have solved some of the problems previously identified by other authors in the literature and provide new directions for future research.
