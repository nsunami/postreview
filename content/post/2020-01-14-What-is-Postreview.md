Welcome to **Postreview**!
Traditional peer-review publishing doesn't always guarantee a high-quality of a paper. Because of this we need a system where experts can evaluate papers in their field.
Here you can share your opinion on the papers you have read. 

Found a particularly low-quality paper in a high-profile journal? We would like to hear about that! 
Found a fantastic paper and wish more scientists would read this overlooked gem? We would **love** to hear about that!

The project is currently maintained by two graduate students and is being supported by efforts of ResearchHub!
Join us today in making navigation through the ocean of published papers easier!
