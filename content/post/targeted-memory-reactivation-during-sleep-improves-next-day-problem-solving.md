# PostReview score - 92/100

## Digest of the Paper

#### Question

#### Rationale

#### Results

#### Conclusion & implications

## Strong and weak points

The strongest part of the paper is its methodology. The authors have implemented a very sophisticated and demanding procedure that allowed them to achieve a very unusual goal - to direct the mental activity of a person that is not fully conscious.  

The weakest part of the paper potentially lies in the design. As it stands now there is no way to disambiguate the effect of sleep from the effect of delayed cueing. In other words, one could speculate that if participants were reminded of the unsolved problems (via sound cues) during the wakeful hours (e.g. in the evening after the first session) - they would have had similar boost in the solution rate next day. Adding the wakeful cueing control condition in the follow-up studies would allows us to disambiguate these 2 effects.

# Quantitative assessment

| Item # | Section | Items | Additional notes | Reviewer score |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Title | How informative and appropriate is the title? | The title should match the content of the paper and should never be misleading | 6 |
| 2 | Abstract | How well are the key findings summarized in a narrative form? | How well does the abstract reflect the actual content of the paper? Is it accurate and concise or confusing and misleading? | 7 |
| 3 | Introduction: previous studies | How thoroughly are the relevant contemporary studies summarized? Is their relevance explained? | Did the authors adequately set the stage for their study? | 7 |
| 4 | Introduction: research question | Is the focal research question clearly laid out in the introduction? | Ideally hypotheses should be explicitly spelled out | 7 |
| 5 | Method: sampling (overall) | How well are the sampling specifications stated? | Initial sample size (+exclusions), basic demographic details, when and how participants were recruited? | 5 |
| 6 | Method: conditions | How explicitly is the design stated? Are the resulting conditions listed and described? | Do the authors specify the design explicitly, with detailed descriptions of experimental conditions? | 5 |
| 7 | Method: procedure | How thoroughly is the procedure described? | Is the reader guided through the timeline of what activities participants engaged in (and in what order)? Are the properties of the stimuli materials (and used devices if relevant) stated? Would one be able to perfectly reproduce the study using this information? | 7 |
| 8 | Results: analytic strategy | How well is the analytic strategy described? | Do the authors state what analyses were performed to test the hypotheses? What was the rationale behind their choice? Does their analytic strategy seem appropriate to the design? Was the data preprocessed in any way (averaging, outlier exclusion, etc.)? Why and how? | 7 |
| 9 | Results: analyses output | How well are the results of the statistical analyses described? | Were all the relevant statistical analyses test results reported for each corresponding primary outcome? Was the effect size estimate reported alongside the significance test results? | 7 |
| 10 | Discussion: hypotheses | How well do the authors articulate whether the data supported the hypotheses or not? | A statement of support or nonsupport for all hypotheses, whether primary or secondary is expected | 7 |
| 11 | Discussion: relation to other studies | How well are the results discussed in the context of relevant contemporary studies? | Do the authors discuss the similarities and differences between reported results and other work in the field? | 7 |
| 12 | Discussion: limitations | Are the limitations of the paper discussed in sufficient detail? | Do the authors discuss the limitations of their study? What would they do differently in the ideal circumstances if they had a chance? | 7 |
| 13 | Discussion: implications | Are the implications sufficiently explored? | Do the authors discuss the implications of the results for future research, programs, or policies? | 5 |
