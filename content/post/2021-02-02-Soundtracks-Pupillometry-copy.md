# Review

Abstract lacks a complete summary of the presented study. The authors missed the information about some crucial elements, for example, sampling and demographic of the subjects and setting, etc. The focus is totally on details about the study procedure. Besides, the aim and conclusion are not explained clearly.

The previous studies given in the introduction section described the versatile application of music in different contexts along with their pros and cons. However, there appears a slight gap between the study conducted by researchers and highlighted variables of the study. The investigated variables are poorly documented in the literature.

The aim of the study is discussed. The research questions are well defined and specific in relevance to the study. Each of the studies displayed its hypotheses.

The sampling strategy is specified in terms of demographic information and sample size with the number of exclusions. But the inclusion and exclusion criteria are not organized before the sampling.

The sampling conditions are described for each of the study groups. The authors explicitly share the conditions in each of the groups. The design and the experimental conditions are the most detailed narrative in the complete research article.

The sampling procedure and measures are structured. Such description can be used smoothly to reproduce similar stimuli and information may help in the replication of the study and results.

The data analysis strategy is conducted in detail based on the analysis rationale and design because it analyzes the score differences of all groups together. They choose appropriate analysis for the hypotheses. The choice of analyses for this study is discussed in detail. The characteristics of the participants are also portrayed.

The output of the analysis is significantly shown. The primary outcome is aligned with the research. The authors use different ways to verify the hypotheses wise outcome in great detail. The charts and graphs add much value with the tables to present every hypothesis.

The gender differences and research questions are covered in the discussion based on the table and presentation of results in the output section. It would be better if the discussion is based on all the variables in sequence as used in the study.

Discussion about other studies is not well described. The context of relevant and contemporary studies didn’t provide insight concerning every aspect of the results. However, few studies that reported similar outcomes are listed.

The limitations are elaborative with the confusing and questionable statements. The authors are not sure if the circumstances they pointed out are the limitations of the study or not. Ideally, the study limitations are not potentially relevant.

Implications are vaguely added within the conclusion of the study. It blurs the accurate and tough description of the study’s conclusion. This fails to elicit critical thoughts and overview about the possibilities for future programs and policies with the directions all the variables investigation of the study possibly suggest. No recommendations are accurately perceived.
