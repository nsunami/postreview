| 1      | Title                                 | How informative and appropriate is the title?                                                  | The title should match the content of the paper and should never be misleading                                                                                                                                                                                             |        X      |
| 2      | Abstract                              | How well are the key findings summarized in a narrative form?                                  | How well does the abstract reflect the actual content of the paper?

| 4      | Introduction: research question       | Is the focal research question clearly laid out in the introduction?                           | Ideally hypotheses should be explicitly spelled out                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |        X      |

| 6      | Method: conditions                    | How explicitly is the design stated? Are the resulting conditions listed and described?        | Do the authors specify the design explicitly, with detailed descriptions of experimental conditions?                                                                                                                                                                       |        X      |

Are the properties of the stimuli materials (and used devices if relevant) stated? Would one be able to perfectly reproduce the study using this information?    |        X      |
| 8      | Results: analytic strategy            | How well is the analytic strategy described?                                                   | Do the authors state what analyses were performed to test the hypotheses? What was the rationale behind their choice? Does their analytic strategy seem appropriate to the design? Was the data preprocessed in any way (averaging, outlier exclusion, etc.)? Why and how? |        X      |
| 9      | Results: analyses output              | How well are the results of the statistical analyses described?                                | Were all the relevant statistical analyses test results reported for each corresponding primary outcome?

| 10     | Discussion: hypotheses                | How well do the authors articulate whether the data supported the hypotheses or not?           | A statement of support or nonsupport for all hypotheses, whether primary or secondary is expected                                                                                                                                                                          |        X      |
| 11     | Discussion: relation to other studies | How well are the results discussed in the context of relevant contemporary studies?            | Do the authors discuss the similarities and differences between reported results and other work in the field?                                                                                                                                                              |        X      |
| 12     | Discussion: limitations               | Are the limitations of the paper discussed in sufficient detail?                               | Do the authors discuss the limitations of their study? What would they do differently in the ideal circumstances if they had a chance?                                                                                                                                     |        X      |
