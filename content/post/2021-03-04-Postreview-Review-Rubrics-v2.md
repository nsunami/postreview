Below is the Postreview Reviewing Rubric. The rubric is intended to evaluate a already-published paper.

# Reviewing Guide
Thank you for participating in post-reviewing a paper.
You will have three goals when evaluating the paper using these guidelines: quantitative assessment, narrative digest and forward thinking questions.

## Quantitative assessment

Use the rubrics in the table below to assign ratings (ranging from 1 to 7) to various aspects of the paper you are evaluating. You do not need to articulate your decision in this part of the evaluation process.

### Rubric Explanation
* Items: The aspect of the paper you are estimating in each rubric can be found in the “items” column.
* Additional notes: details about the things we want you to pay the most attention to.
* Scale: For every item, please rate the quality of the particular aspect of the paper on a scale from 1 to 7. The examples of lowest (terrible quality) and highest (fantastic quality) ratings are provided in the table for each rubric.


If a study contains multiple experiments – your assessment should reflect the quality of the experiment with the lowest quality. A paper with 4 amazing experiments and 1 terrible experiment should receive low scores on the review. The rationale here is that if the initial study produced flawed and biased results, building follow-up studies on such basis can lead to flawed and biased results even if the quality of the follow-up studies is high.

There is an exception to this rule, however! If the authors seem aware of the limitations of the original study and are attempting to refine their method in study 2, 3, etc. - you can disregard the low quality of the original study when giving the final evaluation and only consider the revised methodology.

## Digest of the Paper

How would you describe the results of the paper? Please write an easy-to-digest summary of the paper below. Your summary should be understandable by a non-scientist. Imagine talking about the results to a person without a graduate degree—your friend, family member, or a stranger sitting next to you on a plane. How would you describe the study to that person? We recommend answering the following points by 1-2 sentences each:


* Question: What are the authors trying to figure out?  What did the authors think would happen?
* Rationale: Why did the authors think that way? Were the previous studies in the field pointing at this prediction?
* Results: What did the authors find out? Explain the pattern of the key results.
* Conclusion & implications: Why do the results matter to the society?

Verdict (1-2 sentences each):
* What is the strongest part of the paper? Something they did right in your opinion.
* What is the weakest part of the paper? Something they did wrong in your opinion.

### Forward Thinking Questions
What are the questions you had while reading the paper? Please break down your questions into conceptual questions and method questions (1 each):
* Conceptual questions: questions about broader implications for society and science (e.g., would the results extend to explain a certain process in the world? Would concept from another literature explain the results and should we consider this connection?). Often these questions assume that the results are true.
* Method questions: questions about the methodology used in the results. (e.g., Is the method used in the study appropriate to test this hypothesis? Would it be helpful to run an additional analysis to look at the obtained data at a different angle?)



**Note that questions will be posted on ResearchHub with your name. You will earn RSC if people answer your questions.**
